# Remarkable Employee Site
This project was thought of and created for employees exclusively of a single company with the idea that it can grow to multiple regions where that company has other site.

That being said, this is minimal content for the general public.

## The public pages
there is a home page the public will go to that lists the mission and what the company stands for.

## Basic user
From there one can create an account, all accounts are created as a basic user and it is up to the admin the change the user status to admin.

Once the user has created an account, that are automatically logged in and directed to their homepage where they can edit their information if they choose to do so.

They can navigate the page, add posts to the announcement forum, then delete or edit any of their posts only

The image section is for uploading their images, there too they can delete any image or edit the caption.

Lastly, the basic user can go to the employee list page where they see a list of other employees, only the employees not the admins, and can click on a name to see their basic info, name, email, and department.  

Finally, they can simply logout.

## Admin section
Once a user is changed to an admin, the admins, again once logged in are sent to their home page where they can edit their basic info. 

The forum past and image pages are similar to the basic user, although they are seeing the some info as the basic user at this time I have kept the directory different because my plans are that the admins will be able to post content that will not be visible to the basic user in the future. This is for both the announcements and images.

For the employee list, the admins can see both the employees and admins, this is different from the basic user. The admins can also edit and delete the employees accounts.

Lastly, they simply logout
